description: >
  This is a multiplayer adaptation of the classic rock-paper-scissors gameâ€”you need at least two devices to play the game.
  Select "Host game" from the Main menu to allow your opponent to connect using the "Join game" option. Once the Sub-Ghz connection is established, you can start the battle.\n\nOn your Flipper Zero, press the OK button twice and then press one of three buttons:
  
  - The Up button to select a rock.
  - The Right button to select paper.
  - The Down button to select scissors.
  
  Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
  
  Wins and losses stats are available in the app, as well as the ability to change your name for games.
